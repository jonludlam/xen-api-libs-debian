xen-api-libs for Debian
-----------------------

The ocamlfind packages are installed under /usr/lib/ocaml/xcp. In order to use
them, please set your OCAMLPATH variable to include this path. Additionally, to
use bytecode compilation you'll need to set CAML_LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include
/usr/lib/ocaml/xcp/stublibs.
